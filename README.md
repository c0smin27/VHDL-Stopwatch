# VHDL Stopwatch

The stopwatch counts from **00.00** seconds to **99.99** seconds. <br>
It uses two buttons: one for **start/stop** and another for **reset**. <br>
The numbers are displayed on the boardâ€™s seven-segment display using its anodes and cathodes. <br>

## Hardware/Software
- Basys3 Atrix-7 FPGA Board
- Vivado Design Suite from Xilinx
